  This paper presents an innovative approach to semi-supervised graph learning, addressing the challenges of expensive labeling and graph structure fuzziness. The authors propose a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm based on self-supervised star graph optimal embedding, utilizing a progressive spontaneous strategy of anchor graphs. The method incorporates feature assignment rules for unlabeled samples and constructs a probabilistic extension model to extract pseudo-labeled information. Additionally, the authors introduce a star graph optimization method inspired by graph structure filtering to enhance the accuracy of graph regularization.
