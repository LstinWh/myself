  In this article, a novel self-initiated unsupervised subspace learning method named robust nonnegative matrix factorization with self-initiated multigraph contrastive fusion (RNMF-SMGF) is proposed. RNMF-SMGF is capable of creating samples with different angles and learning different graph structures based on these different angles in a self-initiated method without changing the original data.
